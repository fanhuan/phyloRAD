consense and treedist are from the PHYLIP package written by Joseph Felsenstein, Akiko Fuseki, Sean Lamont, and Andrew Keeffe.

fitch\_kmerX and fitch\_kmerX\_long are modified from fitch from the PHYLIP package by Tony Ives, Huan Fan and Jacob Usinowicz to use in the AAF pipeline (Fan et al. 2015).

kmer\_count(x) and kmer\_merge(filter) are written by Jue Ruan, ReadsSelector is written by Chengxi Ye and modified later by Huan Fan in order to be able to process gzip files, either kmers or reads, and output selected reads in gzip format. They are all from the package Reference-free (Kua et al. 2012).
